# Palette - a simple colour palette picker

I saw somebody using the golden ratio to inform how they
use a pre-defined colour palette and I though that was a good
idea. This is a simple golden ratio display for when I'm picking
a colour palette.

Might add some other features later.

All code in a single index.html file because that's cool.
